# Predict-the-onset-of-diabetes-based-on-diagnostic-measures

Course Supervised Learning

Applied a Classification model like Naive Bayes to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on the diagnostic features. Pima_Indian_Diabetes dataset was used to train and test the model on the basis of accuracy matrix values.

Skills and Tools
